## Smart VIN Resolution

The extension automatically handles vehicle identification:

- **Single Active Vehicle**: If you have one active Tesla, it's used automatically
- **Multiple Vehicles**: If you have multiple active vehicles, you'll be prompted to choose
- **No Active Vehicles**: Clear error messages if no vehicles are available

## Experimental FSD Detection

**⚠️ Important Disclaimer**: The FSD detection feature is experimental and provides **estimates only**. It is not verified by Tesla or Tessie and should not be considered accurate for official purposes.

### How It Works

The extension analyzes driving patterns to estimate when Full Self-Driving might have been active:

- **Speed Consistency**: FSD maintains very consistent speeds, especially on highways
- **Heading Smoothness**: FSD produces smooth, predictable steering patterns  
- **Route Characteristics**: FSD is more commonly used on highways and longer trips
- **Duration Analysis**: FSD usage typically correlates with longer drive segments

### Confidence Scoring

Each analysis receives a confidence score (0-100%):
- **80-100**: Very High - Strong FSD-like patterns detected
- **60-79**: High - Likely FSD usage based on multiple indicators
- **40-59**: Moderate - Mixed signals, uncertain
- **20-39**: Low - Likely manual driving
- **0-19**: Very Low - Manual driving patterns

### Limitations

- **No Ground Truth**: Tesla doesn't provide official FSD usage data
- **Pattern-Based Only**: Analysis relies on driving patterns, not direct FSD status
- **Individual Variation**: Driving styles vary; what looks like FSD for one person might be manual for another
- **External Factors**: Weather, traffic, and road conditions can affect patterns
- **Experimental Feature**: This is a research tool, not a definitive measurement

Use FSD detection results for personal analysis and insights, but don't rely on them for anything requiring precision.
